# 🔧 Profile Page Flickering Fix

## 🐛 **Problem Identified**

The profile page was flickering even though profiles were being found successfully. The console showed "Profile found:" but the UI kept jumping/flickering.

## 🔍 **Root Causes**

### **1. Unnecessary useEffect Dependency**
```typescript
// BEFORE (causing re-renders)
useEffect(() => {
  // ... profile loading logic
}, [resolvedParams?.walletAddress, authClient]); // ❌ authClient changes frequently
```

The `authClient` from `useClientProfile()` was changing frequently during wallet connection states, causing the profile loading effect to run repeatedly.

### **2. Unnecessary State Updates**
```typescript
// BEFORE (causing flickering)
if (profile) {
  setClientProfile(profile); // ❌ Always updates, even if same profile
}
```

The profile was being set even when it was the same data, causing unnecessary re-renders.

### **3. Race Conditions**
Multiple profile loading requests could be triggered simultaneously, leading to inconsistent state updates.

## ✅ **Solutions Applied**

### **1. Removed Unnecessary Dependency**
```typescript
// AFTER (stable)
useEffect(() => {
  // ... profile loading logic
}, [resolvedParams?.walletAddress]); // ✅ Only depends on wallet address
```

Now the effect only runs when the wallet address in the URL changes, not when auth state changes.

### **2. Smart State Updates**
```typescript
// AFTER (prevents unnecessary updates)
if (profile) {
  console.log('✅ Profile found:', profile);
  setClientProfile(prev => {
    if (prev?.wallet_address !== profile.wallet_address) {
      return profile;
    }
    return prev || profile; // Use profile if prev is null
  });
}
```

Only updates the profile state if it's actually different or if there was no previous profile.

### **3. Race Condition Prevention**
```typescript
// AFTER (prevents duplicate requests)
const loadingRef = useRef(false);

useEffect(() => {
  if (!resolvedParams?.walletAddress || loadingRef.current) return;
  
  const loadClientProfile = async () => {
    loadingRef.current = true;
    // ... loading logic
    loadingRef.current = false;
  };
}, [resolvedParams?.walletAddress]);
```

Uses a ref to prevent multiple simultaneous loading requests.

### **4. Enhanced Debugging**
```typescript
// Better console logs for debugging
console.log('🔄 ClientProfilePage render:', { ... });
console.log('🔍 Loading profile for wallet:', walletAddress);
console.log('✅ Profile found:', profile);
console.log('❌ No profile found for wallet:', walletAddress);
console.log('💥 Error loading client profile:', error);
```

Added emojis and structured logging to easily track what's happening.

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

After these fixes:

- ✅ **No more flickering** - Profile loads once and stays stable
- ✅ **Better performance** - No unnecessary re-renders or API calls
- ✅ **Consistent state** - No race conditions or conflicting updates
- ✅ **Clear debugging** - Easy to track profile loading in console

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

1. **Open browser** to http://localhost:3000
2. **Navigate to a profile page** like `/client/0x1f6f963c8a5ec87801f1199a7390d211f1c60d3c1e6f8adbfefc6a04716c9bd9`
3. **Check console logs** - should see clear loading sequence without repeats
4. **Watch the UI** - should load once and remain stable, no flickering
5. **Test navigation** - switching between pages should be smooth

## 📊 **Console Log Pattern**

You should now see a clean pattern like:
```
🔄 ClientProfilePage render: { resolvedParams: {...}, clientProfile: false, isLoadingProfile: false, ... }
🔍 Loading profile for wallet: 0x1f6f963c8a5ec87801f1199a7390d211f1c60d3c1e6f8adbfefc6a04716c9bd9
✅ Profile found: { wallet_address: "0x1f6f...", anon_display_name: "...", ... }
🔄 ClientProfilePage render: { resolvedParams: {...}, clientProfile: true, isLoadingProfile: false, ... }
```

**No more repeated loading messages or flickering between states!** 🎉
